# SendPay - Crypto ↔ Fiat Bridge Contract

A production-ready Starknet smart contract for seamless crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto transactions with signature-based security and privacy protection.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Core Components**
- **Signature-Verified Withdrawals**: Cryptographically secure withdrawal processing
- **Privacy Protection**: Uses `tx_ref` (transaction references) instead of storing sensitive bank details
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier admin system for security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against common smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient multi-withdrawal processing
- **Event-Driven**: Complete audit trail for off-chain integration

## 🔄 **Complete Flow Architecture**

### **🆕 Signature-Verified Withdrawal Flow (Primary)**

#### **1. User Initiates Withdrawal**
```javascript
// Frontend calls backend to get signature
const signature = await backendAPI.getWithdrawalSignature({
    user: userAddress,
    amount: amount,
    token: tokenAddress,
    tx_ref: transactionReference,
    nonce: await contract.get_user_nonce(userAddress),
    timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
});

// Frontend calls contract with signature
await contract.withdraw_with_signature(
    request,
    signature.r,
    signature.s
);
```

#### **2. Contract Processing**
```cairo
fn withdraw_with_signature(
    ref self: ContractState,
    request: WithdrawalRequest,
    signature_r: felt252,
    signature_s: felt252,
) {
    // 1. Verify ECDSA signature against backend public key
    // 2. Validate request (amount, token, nonce)
    // 3. Transfer tokens from user → contract
    // 4. Store WithdrawalStatus with STATUS_PROCESSING
    // 5. Emit WithdrawalCreated event
}
```

#### **3. Backend Processing**
```javascript
// Backend listens to WithdrawalCreated events
contract.on('WithdrawalCreated', async (event) => {
    // 1. Process fiat payout to user's bank account
    // 2. Call complete_withdrawal_with_proof()
    await contract.complete_withdrawal_with_proof(
        event.withdrawal_id,
        settlementProof
    );
});
```

#### **4. Completion**
```cairo
fn complete_withdrawal_with_proof(
    ref self: ContractState,
    withdrawal_id: u256,
    proof: SettlementProof,
) {
    // 1. Verify settlement proof
    // 2. Update status to STATUS_COMPLETED
    // 3. Emit WithdrawalCompleted event
}
```

**Total Time: ~10-30 seconds** (fiat processing time only)

---

### **💰 Deposit Flow (On-Ramp)**

#### **1. User Sends Fiat**
- User sends fiat to designated bank account
- Backend detects fiat deposit via bank API

#### **2. Backend Credits User**
```javascript
// Backend calls contract to credit user
await contract.deposit_and_credit(
    userAddress,
    amount,
    fiatTransactionReference
);
```

#### **3. Contract Processing**
```cairo
fn deposit_and_credit(
    ref self: ContractState,
    user: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    fiat_tx_ref: felt252,
) {
    // 1. Verify caller has BACKEND_ADMIN_ROLE or MANUAL_ADMIN_ROLE
    // 2. Check idempotency (fiat_tx_ref not already credited)
    // 3. Transfer USDC from contract → user
    // 4. Store DepositRecord
    // 5. Emit DepositCompleted event
}
```

**Total Time: ~10-30 seconds** (automated)

## 🔐 **Security Architecture**

### **Cryptographic Security**
- **ECDSA Signature Verification**: All withdrawals require backend signature
- **Poseidon Hashing**: For `tx_ref` generation and withdrawal uniqueness
- **Nonce-based Replay Protection**: Perfect replay prevention per user
- **Hash-based Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate processing

### **Access Control System**
| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE** | Contract owner, can grant/revoke all roles | Initial setup, emergency control |
| **BACKEND_ADMIN_ROLE** | Automated processing, signature verification | Backend automation, instant withdrawals |
| **MANUAL_ADMIN_ROLE** | Human oversight, emergency controls | Manual review, emergency pause |

### **Privacy Protection**
- **No PII Storage**: Bank details stored as `tx_ref` (transaction references)
- **Off-chain PII**: Actual bank details stored in encrypted backend database
- **Hash-based References**: `tx_ref` = Poseidon hash of bank details

## 📊 **Data Structures**

### **WithdrawalRequest (Signature-Based)**
```cairo
struct WithdrawalRequest {
    user: ContractAddress,      // User requesting withdrawal
    amount: u256,              // Amount to withdraw
    token: ContractAddress,    // Token contract address
    tx_ref: felt252,          // Transaction reference (hashed bank details)
    nonce: u256,              // User nonce for replay protection
    timestamp: u64,           // Request timestamp
}
```

### **WithdrawalStatus (On-Chain Record)**
```cairo
struct WithdrawalStatus {
    withdrawal_id: u256,       // Unique withdrawal ID
    user: ContractAddress,     // User address
    amount: u256,             // Withdrawal amount
    token_address: ContractAddress, // Token contract
    tx_ref: felt252,          // Transaction reference
    timestamp: u64,           // Creation timestamp
    status: u8,               // 0=PROCESSING, 1=COMPLETED, 2=FAILED
    block_number: u64,        // Block number
    nonce: u256,              // User nonce
}
```

### **SettlementProof (Off-Chain Integration)**
```cairo
struct SettlementProof {
    fiat_tx_hash: felt252,     // Fiat transaction hash
    settled_amount: u256,      // Actual settled amount
    timestamp: u64,           // Settlement timestamp
    backend_signature: felt252, // Backend signature
}
```

---

## 🚀 **Backend Integration**

### **Signature Generation (Node.js)**
```javascript
const { ec } = require('elliptic');
const { poseidonHash } = require('starknet-crypto');

class BackendSigner {
    constructor(privateKey) {
        this.ec = new ec('secp256k1');
        this.key = this.ec.keyFromPrivate(privateKey, 'hex');
    }

    signWithdrawalRequest(request) {
        const messageHash = poseidonHash([
            request.user,           // ContractAddress
            request.amount,         // u256
            request.token,          // ContractAddress
            request.tx_ref,         // felt252
            request.nonce,          // u256
            request.timestamp       // u64
        ]);
        
        const signature = this.key.sign(messageHash);
        return {
            r: signature.r.toString('hex'),
            s: signature.s.toString('hex')
        };
    }
}
```

### **Event Monitoring**
```javascript
// Listen to withdrawal events
contract.on('WithdrawalCreated', async (event) => {
    console.log(`Processing withdrawal ${event.withdrawal_id} for ${event.user}`);
    // Process fiat payout...
});

contract.on('WithdrawalCompleted', async (event) => {
    console.log(`Withdrawal ${event.withdrawal_id} completed`);
    // Update user balance...
});
```

### **Settlement Proof Generation**
```javascript
async function generateSettlementProof(fiatTxHash, settledAmount) {
    const proof = {
        fiat_tx_hash: fiatTxHash,
        settled_amount: settledAmount,
        timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
        backend_signature: await signSettlementProof(fiatTxHash, settledAmount)
    };
    
    return proof;
}
```
